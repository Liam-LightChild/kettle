# Kettle Minecraft
_Work in Progress Alternate Minecraft Server (un-official)_

## What is a kettle?
A Kotlin Minecraft Server I'm making. It isn't fully implemented yet and won't be for a while, though the JoinGame packet works. It currently does no
authentication with Mojang's servers.

Though if you were looking for the object, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle).

## How to understand the language of the kettles.
[wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Protocol) provides a lot of nice documentation of the protocol. The code itself isn't documented yet, I'll add documentation
later.

## How to make a kettle:
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/LiamCoalStudio/kettle`
2. `cd kettle`
3. `mvn package` (if on windows, omit the `./`)
4. Jar is in `target/kettle-<version>.jar`
